**Spatial domain image to Frequency domain image (Fourier Transformation)**

Key concepts to understand:
* How (U, V) coordinates relate to spatial frequencies of the image.
* Why the Fourier Transform is needed to reconstruct the image.
* What challenges arise from missing data (sparse UV coverage).
